Me and my team pair created a game where the player is controlled by a user is interacting through the key controls on the keyboard to get into Swapfiets store and to eventually buy a bicycle to ride later. 

Installation of the Project: Since my game is made in Processing 4.3, Processing 4.3 has to be installed. (https://processing.org/download) As the apporiate Processing 4.3 is installed according to the operating system of your computer from the link given above, you can download the zip. As you download and then extract the zip file, you will see that it contains the required seperate files to run the game correctly.

For the game, just click on one of the Processing 4.3 file of the game and open the Processing 4.3 program of the animation. As you open the Processing 4.3 program, you will notice a triangle inside circle at top left. Click on that to start playing the agem and just follow the instructions on the screen. Enjoy!

You can also watch the recording of me playing the game without the need of getting into installation and running of Processing 4.3 However, I strongly recommand installing Processing 4.3 and running the animations on it for much better graphics and quality in general.
